## Welcome ðŸ‘‹ <a href="#top" id="top"></a>

Hi everyone, welcome to your CS1101S Studio sessions! These will be 2 hour long sessions, and we'll cover some topics that will be related to concepts taught in lectures, recitations and missions/quests. I'll try to **recap some lecture content** here and there, and go through some queries and common mistakes I saw during grading, during the first part of these sessions. Afterwards, we'll have **weekly studio sheets** that you need to prepare beforehand! Don't worry, these are mindnumbingly touch, just think of them as thought exercises :D. We'll also have an **in-class studio sheet** that you need to do on the spot, but I'll be there to guide you through it!

### Studio Materials <a href="#studio-materials" id="studio-materials"></a>

I'm doing something new this time round, I'll post all the Studio materials, slides, etc. on this site. Feel free to bookmark this and use as a resource!

> Since there are **in-class** studio sheets, I'll only post them during the studio sessions.
