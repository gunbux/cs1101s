## Welcome üëã <a href="#top" id="top"></a>

Hi everyone, welcome to CS1101S Studio! In each weekly 2-hour-long studio session, we will be looking at questions that reinforce important concepts covered in lectures and missions/quests. We will start off with a **brief recap of lecture content** (if time permits) and move on to the **weekly studio sheets**. In addition to that, there will also be extra questions, in the form of **in-class studio sheets**, that you will be attempting together with your friends in the same studio!

### Studio Materials <a href="#studio-materials" id="studio-materials"></a>

As you can see on the sidebar to your ‚¨ÖÔ∏è, there are individual pages for each studio where you can find the **slides**, and most importantly, a collection of questions/content (or interesting/cool things) that were discussed in the respective studios. The link to download in-class studio sheets are also there.

Caution

Since these are **in-class** studio sheets, the link will be active only during studio sessions.
